## Problem 14.2

(a) & (b)

```{r}
x <- c(.34,1.38,-.65,.68,1.4,-.88,-.3,-1.18,.5,-1.75)
y <- c(.27,1.34,-.53,.35,1.28,-.98,-.72,-.81,.64,-1.59)
mod1 <- lm(y~x)
mod2 <- lm(x~y)
plot(x,y)
abline(lm(y~x),lty = 2)
abline(lm(x~y))
legend('bottomright', c("y=a+bx", "x=c+dy"),lty = c(2,1))
mod1
mod2
```

(c) Are the lines in parts (a) and (b) the same? If not, why not?

The lines in parts (a) and (b) are different. For part (a), the predictor is x, the response is y. For part (b), the predictor is y, the respose is x. When we do the least square estimation, we minimize the $\sum_i(Y_i-a-bX_i)^2$ for part (a) and minimize $\sum_i(X_i-c-dY_i)^2$ for part (b). Hence the results are different.
